# Black-Jack-Game

Blackjack is a popular card game played in casinos around the world. The goal of the game is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.

Here are the basic rules for playing blackjack:
-> Objective
- The objective is to have a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer's hand without exceeding 21.

-> Card Values
- Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.
- Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points each.

-> The Deal
1. Each player is dealt two cards face up.
2. The dealer is dealt two cards: one face up and one face down (the hole card).

-> Player's Turn
1. Hit: Take another card from the dealer.
2. Stand: Keep your current hand and end your turn.
3. Double Down: Double your bet, take exactly one more card, and then stand.
4. Surrender: Some games allow you to forfeit your hand immediately after the initial deal, receiving half of your bet back.

-> Dealer's Turn
- After all players have completed their turns, the dealer reveals the hole card.
- The dealer must hit until their cards total 17 or higher. In most casinos, a dealer must hit on a "soft" 17 (a hand containing an Ace valued as 11).

-> Winning and Payouts
- Win: Your hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's, or the dealer busts.
- Push: Your hand and the dealer's hand have the same value. Your bet is returned.
- Lose: Your hand exceeds 21 (bust), or the dealer's hand is closer to 21.
